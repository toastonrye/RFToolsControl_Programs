This was my attempt to recreate the board game Mastermind in modded Minecraft using RFTools Control opcode programming. 
It is not complete, I'm saving it here encase I want to try to finish it someday.

I made a Youtube video demonstrating what works and what I had difficulties finishing, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_wwG1mrI9E
